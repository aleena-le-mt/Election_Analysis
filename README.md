## Challenge Overview
According to this data that we have produced, 10.5% of the votes were from Jefferson with exactly 38,855 votes, 82.8% of the votes were from Denver with 306,055 votes, and 6.7% of the votes were from Arapahoe with 24,801 votes. Through this information, one can say that Denver carried the voting process on who the winning candidate should be because most of the votes are from Denver. With that being said, most people in the Denver county supports candidate Diana DeGette.
## Challenge Summary
While working on this challenge, I mainly had trouble on little typos such as missing parenthesis and semi colons. I was able to find out and fix these things through using the problems tab in VSCode. I think that I was able to successfully do this because of the examples that are similar to this, but it took me awhile because there are things that I had to figure out on my own. Other than that, this is my first time actual coding and my impression of it now is much better than it was before and am willing to learn more in the future.
